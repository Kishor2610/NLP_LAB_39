Java is statically typed and also a strongly typed language.In Java, each type of data (such as integer, character, hexadecimal, packed decimal, and so forth) is Predefined as part of the programming language. All constants or variables defined for a given program must be described with one of the data types.Boolean data type represents only one bit of information either true or false.Which is intended to represent the two truth values of logic and Boolean algebra.The size of the boolean data type is virtual machine-dependent. Values of type boolean are not converted implicitly or explicitly (with casts) to any other type.But the programmer can easily write conversion code.
